React/Redux Voting App
=======================

This is an app that lets you vote on selected movies. 

The intend is for the voters to use the voters page localhost:3000 and for voting admins to use 
localhost:3000/#/results to monitor the voting process and proceed to the next round once voting is complete.

Voting is done in pairs of two at a time. One winner is displayed at the end. 

To run in your local machine

1) cd into `voting-server`
2) `npm install`
3) cd into `voting-server/voting-client`
4) run `npm install`
5) in voting-server/voting-client run `npm start`

This should automatically open your browser in port 3000
